# Note Taker

A note taker app that can be used to write and save notes using an Express.js backend.

## Motivation

This project was built to provide a simple and intuitive way for users to write, save, and manage their notes. It's perfect for anyone who needs to keep track of important information and tasks.

## What it solved

This app solves the problem of note management. With this app, users can easily create new notes, save them for future reference, and delete them when no longer needed.

## What I learned

Through the development of this app, I learned more about Express.js, how to set up a server, and how to handle GET, POST, and DELETE requests.
